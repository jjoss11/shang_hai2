Card game shang-hai

Working to adapt a card game that I would play with my grandparents into C++.

Basics can be found at this website: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shanghai_rum

Big thanks to GitHub user skamchee and his respository "Poker game" which I used as a launching point for this game and AI

This project is turning out to be more conceptually difficult than I had expected. Unlike poker, the value of one's hand is,
especially at the beginning of a hand, is very subjective. This makes the Monte Carlo simulation particuarly difficult to 
execute. I think I'll put this on hold for a bit, and code a simpler game that's simpler to wrap my head around.
